# Dashboard
## 1. Overview
Layoffs, often resulting from financial pressures, strategic pivots, or market volatility, have become increasingly prevalent in recent years—particularly in the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly disrupted global operations, forcing companies to adapt rapidly to changing economic conditions. In the US market, many organisations downsized their workforce to manage declining revenue, operational inefficiencies, overhiring during growth phases, and shifts in consumer demand. This analysis focuses on the US to better understand layoff patterns across industries, company funding levels, and the broader business impact.
This dataset offers an in-depth overview of global company layoffs that took place between March 2020 and March 2023, covering nearly 40 countries and more than 820 companies. Primarily driven by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the insights were derived from a Power BI dashboard that visualises key data points such as industry sectors, total layoffs, funding categories, and funds raised by each company.

## 2. Project Objectives
The objective of this project is to enhance the previous analysis of layoff trends—initially conducted through data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using MySQL—by introducing advanced data visualisation through Power BI. The upgraded version incorporates an interactive dashboard. A key focus of the analysis is to drill down into the country most affected by layoffs—the United States—offering a closer look at the companies and sectors contributing to the trend.

**Key Objectives for the USA Focus**
- To determine which industries and companies in the United States experienced the highest number of layoffs, helping to uncover patterns in sectors most vulnerable to workforce reductions.
- To evaluate how funding categories influenced the scale of layoffs among US-based companies, offering insight into whether higher funding provided stability.
- To track the timeline of layoffs across the US from March 2020 to March 2023, identifying peak periods and correlating them with major economic events or shifts.

**1. Date Range Slider**

Users can adjust the date range to focus on a specific period (e.g., pre- and post-pandemic peaks).This allows exploration of how layoffs evolved over time and whether spikes align with global events or funding cycles.

**2. Dropdown Filters (Country, Industry, Fund Category)**

These filters customise the view based on user needs, allowing to filter by industry, while an investor could focus on funding categories to understand funding vs layoff risk.

**3. KPI Tiles**

When filters are applied, these numbers update instantly which helps users quickly grasp how total layoffs or company shutdowns vary across filters like industry or location.

**4. Time Series Chart**

Hovering or filtering shows how layoffs change month by month. Users can identify layoff surges (e.g., Jan 2023 spike) and drill down to see which companies/industries contributed.

**5. Industry Bar Chart**

This chart can be used to filter the entire dashboard by clicking on a specific industry, helping isolate and compare which sectors had the highest numbers, like Retail or Consumer.

**6. Map Visual (Global Layoffs Overview)**

The clickable regions allow location-specific exploration, helping to nderstand the geographical spread of layoffs.

**7. Scatter Plot (Layoff Impact vs. Funding by Industry)**

Users can spot industries with high funding but also high layoffs—suggesting potential inefficiencies or mismanagement.
